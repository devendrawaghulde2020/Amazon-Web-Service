## LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION

**1] SAAS(Software as a Service)**
>  + SaaS is a method of software delivery that allows data to be accessed from any device with an internet connection and a web browser.
> +  In this web-based model, software vendors host and maintain the servers, databases, and the code that makes up an application.

> + The cloud-based model is so common now that more than 60% of software seekers who call Software Advice only want web-based products—less than 2% specifically ask for on-premise software.

### There are two keys:

> + SaaS deployments don’t require extensive hardware.

> + SaaS systems are typically paid within a subscription model.

**2] PAAS[Platform as a Service]**
> + Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools usually those needed for application development to users over the internet.
> +  A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure.
 > + As a result, PaaS frees developers from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.  

**3]IAAS[Infrastructure as a Service]**
> + Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. 
> + IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. 
> + It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure.
> +  Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. 
> + A cloud computing service provider, such as Azure, manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—operating systems, middleware, and applications.
